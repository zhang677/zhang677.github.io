ML libraries, such as cuDNN and MIOpen, provide high-performance implementation of the operators in ML frameworks such as PyTorch and Jax. They are key to efficient ML systems. ML libraries are often written in architecture-specific programming languages (ASPLs) that target domain-specific architectures (DSAs).
