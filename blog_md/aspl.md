# ML library development using ASPLs

ML libraries, such as cuDNN and MIOpen, provide high-performance implementation of the operators in ML frameworks such as PyTorch and Jax. They are key to efficient ML systems. ML libraries are often written in architecture-specific programming languages (ASPLs) that target domain-specific architectures (DSAs). Figure 1 shows an example of ML library development.

    <strong>Figure 1:</strong> STeP is an ASPL that abstracts the execution on a DSA called reconfigurable dataflow architecture. As an analogy, STeP for reconfigurable dataflow architecture is like CUDA for NVIDIA GPUs. As a task of ML library development, a simplified mixture-of-expert (MoE) module is implemented using STeP.

However, writing these high-performance ML libraries is challenging because it needs expert knowledge of ML algorithms and the ASPL. This process requires complex reasoning to compose high-level ML model components (“operators”) with low-level hardware primitives. Meanwhile, ASPLs are updated per generation of DSA, so there is limited data as shown in Figure 2.

# Adaptive Self-improvement LLM Agentic System

Large language models (LLMs) have shed light on solving complex programming tasks. This work explores LLMs’ potential for automating ML library development. We propose an adaptive self-improvement learning algorithm integrated with an agentic system organization that orchestrates LLMs with different capabilities. Figure 3 shows the system diagram.

    <strong>Figure 3:</strong> LLM agents start from their base knowledge and accumulate experiences through parallel sampling. Our adaptive self-improvement learning algorithm filters high-quality answers, stratifies the earned experiences by difficulty, and adaptively selects demonstrations to enhance LLM agents.

We find that adaptive self-improvement can elevate weaker base models above powerful reasoning models; self-improved DeepSeek-V3 completes 3.9x more tasks than a single DeepSeek-V3 and outperforms OpenAI-o1. Adaptively selecting a smaller number of high-quality demonstrations can outperform larger quantities of lower-quality demonstrations. Interestingly, Claude 3.5 Sonnet unexpectedly surpasses other models, including self-improved DeepSeek-V3.


<strong>Adaptive self-improvement learning</strong> evolves LLM agents with data generated by themselves. As shown in Figure 4, LLM agents accumulate experience through sampling on each task, with experiences becoming more hard-earned as success rates decrease. Our algorithm prioritizes hard-earned experiences as demonstrations. When these hard-earned experiences are used up, the algorithm adaptively increases the number of demonstrations by mixing experiences earned from less challenging tasks. Such experience stratification and adaptive selection is inspired by curriculum learning<sup><a id="ref1-return" href="#ref1">1</a></sup>. As a byproduct, the algorithm adaptively increases test-time compute on challenging tasks until they are finished or the data is used up.

    <strong>Figure 4:</strong> White, green, and orange circles represent unfinished tasks, finished tasks and selected experiences, respectively. Experiences are stratified into 3 levels: hard, medium, and easy based on the number of correct samples.

<strong>The agentic system organization</strong> is ASPL-specific. We choose Streaming Tensor Programs (STeP)<sup><a id="ref2-return" href="#ref2">2</a></sup> as the target ASPL for library generation. STeP is an emerging ASPL designed for next-generation reconfigurable dataflow architectures<sup><a id="ref3-return" href="#ref3">3</a></sup>, a family of DSAs for AI. As shown in Figure 1, we build an LLM system that can generate the STeP program that implements the PyTorch program on top.

As shown in Figure 5, we design two agents, a proposer, which generates a candidate STeP implementation,  and a guardian that checks and corrects the affine type error. The verifier wraps the STeP implementation with testing logic and feeds it to two checkers for (i) functional correctness and (ii) affine type constraint. Structural intermediate representation (IR) encodes necessary information using a data serialization language. This distinguishes our system from coding agents that directly deal with source code as shown in Figure 6.

# Key results

We benchmarked 8 groups of ML operators for a common LLM layer and collected 26 tasks in total. We select frontier models from four providers: Claude 3.5 Sonnet from Anthropic, o1 and GPT-4o from OpenAI, Llama 3.1-405B from Meta, and DeepSeek-V3 from DeepSeek. DeepSeek-V3 was just announced in December 2024. OpenAI o1 implements a test-time compute strategy for general reasoning tasks and is 6 times more expensive than GPT-4o per token. All four other models are base models without a predefined test-time compute strategy. 

Here we share three interesting findings:
1. Adaptive self-improvement learning can augment relatively weak base models to surpass a powerful general reasoning model. As shown in Figure 7(a), self-improved DeepSeek-V3 outperforms OpenAI-o1, successfully implementing 57.7% of operators compared to OpenAI-o1's 38.5%.
2. Claude 3.5 Sonnet is surprisingly better than other models although they have similar scores on common coding benchmarks (e.g. on HumanEval-Mul all models achieve around 80% Pass@1 as in Figure 6 of DeepSeek-V3 technical report<sup><a id="ref4-return" href="#ref4">4</a></sup>). As shown in Figure 7(a), even single Claude 3.5 Sonnet is better than self-improved DeepSeek-V3.
3. Experience stratification can improve data efficiency. As shown in Figure 7(b), a smaller number of input tokens can sometimes outperform a larger number due to the higher quality of experiences.

# Impact
Our approach not only produces a self-improving agentic system to assist humans but also generates high-quality ML operators that can be leveraged by other systems. By enabling users without extensive ASPL expertise to construct efficient ML operators, this advancement could democratize access to ML development tools and reduce the technical barriers to entry. As stronger models emerge, such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o3-mini, our tasks can offer a good benchmark to test their complex reasoning with limited data.
